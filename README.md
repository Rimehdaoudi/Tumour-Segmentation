# Tumour Segmentation
This repository contains the python implementation used to segment tumours from 2D brain scans using the U-Net archietecture. The code was developed based on the research I carried
out during my disertation for my MSc degree at University College Dublin where I explored medical image segmentation using a basic U-Net architecture and bechmarked its performance
to other similar segmentation methods.
